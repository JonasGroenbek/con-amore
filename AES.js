/*
The most commonly used symmetric algorithm is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES),
which was originally known as Rijndael. This is the standard set by the U.S.
National Institute of Standards and Technology in 2001 for the encryption of electronic data
announced in U.S. FIPS PUB 197. This standard supersedes DES, which had been in use since 1977.
Under NIST, the AES cipher has a block size of 128 bits,
but can have three different key lengths as shown with AES-128, 
AES-192 and AES-256.
